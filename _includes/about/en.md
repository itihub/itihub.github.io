Hi, Welcome to ITI Hub. 




##### My Programming Languages Spectrum

I generally prefer languages that are close to ML ("Meta Language"), i.e. _mostly functional programming_. This should explain most of my picks e.g. JavaScript within dynamically-typed's, Scala within JVM's, Rust within unmanaged's. Other preferences such as typed over untyped, expressive over limited are no-brainers.
